    of what functions/procedures to implement in java

for domenico: test procedures, we test adding information on compilation and hows its going to layout

for johnny: can do delete procedures (ashley can do it if she wants), implementing procedures to java
//to use delete, use a cursor to go through all info

What initial data should be shown? JSON or directly insert in table set up
