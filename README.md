Setup: 

-Open the src folder and run the SQL queries to create the tables and data.
-Open the Application class and run that. Once ran, you should enter the values of your choice,
such as creating data, deleting data, updating data or viewing data.



## Getting started

To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab, here's a list of recommended next steps.

# Editing this README

When you're ready to make this README your own, just edit this file and use the handy template below (or feel free to structure it however you want - this is just a starting point!).  Thank you to [makeareadme.com](https://gitlab.com/-/experiment/new_project_readme_content:1a64d01f3ae0da3ba2037e2565e47e77?https://www.makeareadme.com/) for this template.

## Suggestions for a good README
Every project is different, so consider which of these sections apply to yours. The sections used in the template are suggestions for most open source projects. Also keep in mind that while a README can be too long and detailed, too long is better than too short. If you think your README is too long, consider utilizing another form of documentation rather than cutting out information.

## Name
Final Database II Project

## Description
Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Installation
First of all, execute the setup.sql file. The fill will create tables needed to run the database.
Second, under the packages folder, execute the packageSetUp.sql file and triggers.sql file.
Third, run the insertdata.sql, which will add data to the tables.
Fourth, run the Application.java file. To run unit tests, insert credentials to String variables.
## Usage
This program will let you view data, add data, update data, remove data from the database tables.
